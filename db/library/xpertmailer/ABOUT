
ABOUT THIS PACKAGE
==================

This is XPertMailer Version 4.0.2, simple name XPM4 v.0.2.

  XPertMailer is a PHP class that will help you send/read encoded
MIME type mail messages (text, HTML, HTML embedded images, attachments)
towards a localhost, client, relay with optional authentication and
TLS/SSL support. Cc and Bcc functionality are included.
  The XPertMailer class functions are optimised to execute in a very 
small time and also to be easy to use. This reduces the size of the 
code and the time required to write it.
  The names of the public functions in the XPertMailer class are 
eloquent so that they can be used without any confusions being made.
  The data sendig is done according to the RFC 821, RFC 822, RFC 2821,
RFC 2822, RFC 2487 and the message type is in conformity with the
RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2048 and RFC 2049.
